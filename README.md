# Spring Boot Sample Projects

Note: All version configuration, base dependencies, etc are stored in the root build.gradle. The intent
is to focus on the individual features, at the expense of additional copy-paste for standalone
projects.

## Spring Boot DevServer

From a subproject's directory, run: `gradle bootRun`

## Building deployable JAR

From a subproject's directory, run: `gradle build`
